%% Chapter 10 - Exercises

%% Exercise 10.1 - Suppose we have the following database:

p(1).
p(2) :- !.
p(3).

%% Write all of Prolog’s answers to the following queries:

%% ?-  p(X).
%% X = 1 ;
%% X = 2.

%% ?-  p(X),p(Y).
%% X = Y, Y = 1 ;
%% X = 1,
%% Y = 2 ;
%% X = 2,
%% Y = 1 ;
%% X = Y, Y = 2.

%% ?-  p(X),!,p(Y).
%% X = Y, Y = 1 ;
%% X = 1,
%% Y = 2.

%% Exercise 10.2 First, explain what the following program does:

class(Number, positive) :- Number > 0.
class(0, zero).
class(Number, negative) :- Number < 0.

%% This program examines whether the specified Number is positive, zero, or
%% negative.

%% Second, improve it by adding green cuts.
class(Number, positive) :- Number > 0, !.
class(0, zero) :- !.
class(Number, negative) :- Number < 0, !.

%% If we let the second argument be a variable, we stop as soon as we have either
%% determined that Number is positive, zero or negative and don't try the other
%% possibilities after we've gotten _one_ positive result.

%% Exercise 10.3 - Without using cut, write a predicate split/3 that splits a
%% list of integers into two lists: one containing the positive ones (and zero),
%% the other containing the negative ones. For example:

%% split([3,4,-5,-1,0,4,-9],P,N)
%% should return:

%% P = [3,4,0,4].
%% N = [-5,-1,-9].

split([], [], []).

split([HP | TL], [HP | TP], N) :-
  HP >= 0,
  split(TL, TP, N).

split([HN | TL], P, [HN | TN]) :-
  HN < 0,
  split(TL, P, TN).

%% Then improve this program, without changing its meaning, with the help of the
%% cut.

split([], [], []).

split([HP | TL], [HP | TP], N) :-
  HP >= 0, !, % green cut
  split(TL, TP, N).

split([HN | TL], P, [HN | TN]) :-
  HN < 0, !, % green cut
  split(TL, P, TN).

%% Note, if you use split to check if P or N is contained in L, the items have
%% to be ordered the same way as in L.

%% Exercise 10.4
%% Recall that in Exercise 3.3 we gave you the following knowledge base:

directTrain(saarbruecken, dudweiler).
directTrain(forbach, saarbruecken).
directTrain(freyming, forbach).
directTrain(stAvold, freyming).
directTrain(fahlquemont, stAvold).
directTrain(metz, fahlquemont).
directTrain(nancy, metz).

%% We asked you to write a recursive predicate travelFromTo/2 that told us when
%% we could travel by train between two towns.

%% Now, it’s plausible to assume that whenever it is possible to take a direct
%% train from A to B, it is also possible to take a direct train from B to
%% A. Add this information to the database. Then write a predicate route/3 which
%% gives you a list of towns that are visited by taking the train from one town
%% to another. For instance:

%% ?- route(forbach,metz,Route).
%% Route = [forbach,freyming,stAvold,fahlquemont,metz].

directPath(X, Y) :-
    directTrain(X, Y).

directPath(X, Y) :-
    directTrain(Y, X).

%% base case
route(Y, Y, RevL, L) :-
    reverse(RevL, L).

%% inductive case
route(X, Y, RevL, L) :-
    directPath(X, Z),
    not(member(Z, RevL)),
    route(Z, Y, [Z | RevL], L).

%% main
route(X, Y, L) :-
    route(X, Y, [X], L).
